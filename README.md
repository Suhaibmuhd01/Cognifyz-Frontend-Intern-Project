# Cognifyz Frontend Internship Project

This repository contains the frontend project I developed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The project showcases my skills and knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and advanced frontend practices including Sass preprocessing and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a responsive and interactive webpage while demonstrating the following:

- Basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, images)
- Inline CSS styling with responsiveness handled in an external stylesheet
- Responsive design using media queries and Tailwind CSS
- Advanced CSS preprocessing with Sass for enhanced code organization, reusability, and maintainability
- Dynamic content fetching from a public API
- Interactive elements like buttons to change background color
- CSS animations and transitions for a smooth user experience

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Markup structure of the webpage
- **CSS** - Styling, including Sass preprocessing
- **JavaScript** - Interactive functionality and API integration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Sass** - CSS preprocessor used for organizing styles and defining variables

## Key Milestones & Tasks Completed

1. **HTML & CSS Basics**: Developed the structure and styling of the webpage.
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the webpage adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS and media queries.
3. **Sass Preprocessing**: Implemented Sass to enhance the organization of CSS, including variables for colors and font sizes, as well as nested styles.
4. **JavaScript Functionality**: Added interactive elements like the "Read More" button and dynamic content fetched from a public API.
5. **API Integration**: Successfully fetched user data from a public API and displayed it dynamically on the webpage.
6. **Final Styling Adjustments**: Refined the design and layout with Tailwind CSS and animations for a polished look.
